# Clarity: Data Analysis and Visualization Library

> ⚠️ **Beta Version Notice**: Clarity is currently in beta. While functional, it may contain bugs and the API might change in future releases. We welcome feedback and contributions to improve the library!

## Description
Clarity is a Python library that simplifies data analysis and visualization workflows. It provides an intuitive interface for analyzing, cleaning, and visualizing data through three main components:
- `DataAnalyzer`: Performs statistical analysis and generates data summaries
- `DataCleaner`: Handles missing values and removes outliers
- `DataVisualizer`: Creates various plots and visualizations

## Features
- Comprehensive data summarization
- Automated data cleaning
- Missing value handling
- Outlier detection and removal
- Statistical analysis
- Various visualization options:
  - Distribution plots
  - Correlation matrices
  - Missing value heatmaps
  - Box plots

## Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start
```python
import pandas as pd
from clarity.core import DataAnalyzer, DataCleaner, DataVisualizer

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Analyze
analyzer = DataAnalyzer(data)
summary = analyzer.get_summary()

# Clean
cleaner = DataCleaner(data)
cleaner.handle_missing_values()
cleaner.remove_outliers('column_name')

# Visualize
visualizer = DataVisualizer(cleaner.data)
visualizer.plot_distribution('column_name')
visualizer.plot_correlation_matrix()
```
